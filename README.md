# pbj

The pbj package includes a set of parametric bootstrap joint (PBJ)
testing procedures designed for neuroimaging data. The statistical tools
are more generally applicable, but this package is designed to allow
input and output data for NIfTI images. The PBJ tools are designed for
voxel-wise and cluster-extent hypothesis testing methods and include
semi-PBJ (sPBJ) inference that is robust to variance misspecification
using an estimating equations approach.

## Installation

You can install the released version of pbj from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("simonvandekar/pbj")
```
