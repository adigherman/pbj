The parametric bootstrap joint (pbj) methods are designed for voxel-wise
and cluster-extent inference and include semi-PBJ (sPBJ) inference that
is robust to variance misspecification using an estimating equations
approach. The package is designed for neuroimaging data and allows for
input and output of neuroimaging data.

# Ongoing projects

The pbj package is in alpha stage as many features are still being
added.

  - A graphical user interface
  - Semiparametric longitudinal multidimensional inference (F-test in
    repeated measurements models)
  - Semiparametric confidence set inference
  - Effect size based inference
  - Nonparametric bootstrap-based inference

## Installation

You can install the released version of pbj from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("simonvandekar/pbj")
```
