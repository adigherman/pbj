\title{Computes contiguous clusters from a statistical image given a threshold}
\usage{
cluster(
  stat,
  mask,
  cft,
  method = c("extent", "mass"),
  kernel = "box",
  rois = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stat}{A statistical Nifti image as an RNifti image object.}

\item{mask}{A statistical Nifti image mask used in the analysis or a character path to one.}

\item{cft}{A a vector of cluster forming thresholds (on the scale of the test statistic
image, which is usually chi-squared for pbj) for the test statistic image. Will compute cluster sizes or masses for each threshold.}

\item{method}{character string 'extent' or 'mass' indicating whether the cluster extent or cluster mass statistic should be used.}

\item{kernel}{The kernel type to compute connected components.}

\item{rois}{If TRUE, return image with voxel values having the indices of the clusters returned if rois=FALSE.}
}
\value{
Returns list of tables of sizes of the connected components above cft.
