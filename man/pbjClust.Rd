\usage{
pbjClust(statMap, cfts = c(0.01, 0.005), nboot = 5000,
  kernel = "box")
}
\arguments{
\item{statMap}{statMap object as obtained from computeStats.}

\item{cfts}{Numeric vector of cluster forming thresholds to use. These are
single-tailed for chi-squared (or F) statistics or two tailed for
Z-statistics probabilities.}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstraps to perform.}

\item{kernel}{Kernel to use for computing connected components. Box is
default (26 neighbors), but Diamond may also be reasonable.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of length length(cfts)+3. The first three elements contain
statMap$stat, statMap$template, and statMap$mask. The remaining elements are lists containing the following:
\item{pvalues}{A vector of p-values corresponding to the cluster labels in clustermaps.}
\item{clustermap}{A niftiImage object with the cluster labels.}
\item{pmap}{A nifti object with each cluster assigned the negative log10 of its cluster extent FWE adjusted p-value.}
\item{CDF}{A bootstrap CDF.}
